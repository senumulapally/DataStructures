"""
Given the root of a binary tree with unique values and the values of two different nodes of the tree x and y,
return true if the nodes corresponding to the values x and y in the tree are cousins, or false otherwise.
Two nodes of a binary tree are cousins if they have the same depth with different parents.
Note that in a binary tree, the root node is at the depth 0, and children of each depth k node are at the depth k + 1.
